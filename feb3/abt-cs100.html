    <h2>Computer science</h2>
    <font size="4">
        <p>Computer science, the study of computers and computing, including their theoretical and algorithmic
            foundations, hardware and software, and their uses for processing information. The discipline of computer
            science includes the study of algorithms and data structures, computer and network design, modeling data and
            information processes, and artificial intelligence. </p>

    <h2>Computer science foundations</h2>
    <font size="4">
        <p>
            Computer science draws some of its foundations from mathematics and engineering and therefore incorporates
            techniques from areas such as queueing theory, probability and statistics, and electronic circuit design.
            Computer science also makes heavy use of hypothesis testing and experimentation duringthe conceptualization,
            design, measurement, and refinement of new algorithms, information structures, and computer architectures.
